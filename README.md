Materials for the "Advanced Shiny" course for Astra Zeneca.

## Overview

Shiny is the leading R package for developing interactive web apps. These give your clients, users, or students the power and sophistication of R with a friendly, no-code interface custom designed to your purpose. This workshop will begin with an overview of interactivity options in R (R Markdown documents with Shiny components, parameterized reports, and dashboards), will explore features of reactive programming, building complex apps with modules, and will wrap up with a session on troubleshooting Shiny apps.

### Audience

This course is designed for advanced R users who already have some experience with Shiny but want to level up their Shiny skills.
If you need a Shiny refresher ahead of the course, we suggest taking this R Studio tutorial: https://shiny.rstudio.com/tutorial.

### Learning objectives

During this course you will learn about: 

-	Spectrum of reproducible dynamic reporting from R Markdown to Shiny
-	Building functional and visually appealing user interfaces
-	Reactive programming: theory and application
-	Leveraging Shiny modules as your app grows
-	Troubleshooting your Shiny app

After this course you should be able to:

- Create and deploy a Shiny app from scratch
- Enhance a complex Shiny app by breaking it into modules
- Employ a principled approach to debugging Shiny apps
