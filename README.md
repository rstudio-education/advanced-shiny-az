# advanced-shiny-az

## Overview

Shiny is the leading R package for developing interactive web apps. These give your clients, users, or students the power and sophistication of R with a friendly, no-code interface custom designed to your purpose. This workshop will begin with an overview of interactivity options in R (R Markdown documents with Shiny components, parameterized reports, and dashboards), will explore features of reactive programming, building complex apps with modules, and will wrap up with a session on troubleshooting Shiny apps.

### Audience

This course is designed for advanced R users who already have some experience with Shiny but want to level up their Shiny skills.
If you need a Shiny refresher ahead of the course, we suggest taking this R Studio tutorial: https://shiny.rstudio.com/tutorial.

### Learning objectives

During this course you will learn about: 

-	Spectrum of reproducible dynamic reporting from R Markdown to Shiny
-	Building functional and visually appealing user interfaces
-	Reactive programming: theory and application
-	Leveraging Shiny modules as your app grows
-	Troubleshooting your Shiny app

After this course you should be able to:

- Create and deploy a Shiny app from scratch
- Enhance a complex Shiny app by breaking it into modules
- Employ a principled approach to debugging Shiny apps

## Getting materials

All course materials can be found at [rstd.io/adv-shiny-az](https://rstd.io/adv-shiny-az).

You have two options for following along with the exercises:

- On RStudio Cloud (strongly recommended) - Go to [LINK](), log in, and join the workspace.
- Locally - Click on [View the Project on GitHub](https://github.com/rstudio-education/advanced-shiny-az) and either download the contents of the repo or fork and clone it. If you choose this route, start working on the exercises by clicking on the `advanced-shiny-az.Rproj` file to launch the RStudio session and make sure the packages listed below are all installed.
